![Word Search Browser Extension](https://github.com/AbeHiroto/AbeHiroto/blob/main/20241224_rus_ex.gif)
- A simple extension for web browsers that retrieves information about the selected text from an external website
- Extracts data from external websites using the Reqwest and Scraper libraries
- My first 🦀Rust project built with the great help of Llama3.3:70B
- This is for personal use, so only repository of the server is public
- It's required to edit "fn get_data" according to your target website in order to actually run on your environment
